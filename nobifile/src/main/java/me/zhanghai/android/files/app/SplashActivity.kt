 * Entry-point splash activity: shows the branded splash window background
 * and immediately forwards to FileListActivity with a fresh intent.
 * Folder shortcuts and VIEW intents resolve directly to FileListActivity
 * through its own intent filters, so nothing is lost. It is finished
 * before the file list appears and never stays in the back stack.
 *
 * Extends AppActivity on purpose: NobiFile activities must call apply()
 * from AppActivity.onCreate to be theme-tracked. (v29.2: host activities
 * that are not AppActivity subclasses are now skipped by the theme
 * helpers instead of throwing, so this is only about NobiFile's own
 * activities.) The splash window background is drawn from the manifest
 * theme before onCreate, so apply() replacing the theme here changes
 * nothing visible.
